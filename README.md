Decided to adapt [this poster](https://alexvermeer.com/wp-content/uploads/howtogetmotivated-2560x1440.png) into an app because I found it a bit cumbersome to use in its current form. 



### Installation 

Clone down the repo and run 
```
npm i
```
and then
```
npm start
```
or check out the [web app](https://i-am-procrastinating.netlify.app/)

### Technologies used

-React

-CSS

### User stories

#### MVP
-As a user, I want to be able to quickly and easily find methods to help me combat procrastination
-As a user, I want the suggested method to have tips that add clarity or help me perform it
-As a user, I want to be able to store data that helps me track my goals, progress, values, and more

#### Post-MVP
-As a user, I want the app to have built-in tools to help me follow the suggested advice

### Unsolved Issues / Major Hurdles
-I deliberately chose an open-ended project that I can continue to improve over time, currently my next goal for improving the app is finding out the best way to implement the log or journal system that stores input from the user, my current solution is to store that data on the "back" of each respective card that takes input. The user's would then have the option to flip the card over to see what they previously entered, but I would like to be able to something more


-Still experimenting with card flip animations, perhaps all cards will have additional information on the back for users that are interested
