# I Am Procrastinating

The information is based on the latest scientific research on motivation and procrastination as found in Piers Steel's book [The Procrastination Equation](https://www.amazon.com/Procrastination-Equation-Putting-Things-Getting/dp/0061703621) as well as inspired by Alex Vermeer's [blog](https://alexvermeer.com/limit-procrastination/) [posts](https://alexvermeer.com/stop-procrastinating-right-now) and [poster](https://alexvermeer.com/wp-content/uploads/howtogetmotivated-2560x1440.png) based on the same book. 

In line with the procrastination equation, cards colored green help users reduce impulsiveness, blue cards help users increase value, and purple cards help users increase expectancy.

### Unsolved Issues / Major Hurdles
-I deliberately chose an open-ended project that I can continue to improve over time, currently my next goal for improving the app is finding out the best way to implement the log or journal system that stores input from the user, my current solution is to store that data on the "back" of each respective card that takes input. The user's would then have the option to flip the card over to see what they previously entered, but I would like to be able to something more


-Still experimenting with card flip animations, perhaps all cards will have additional information on the back for users that are interested
